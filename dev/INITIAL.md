# Initial Development Directive: Architectural Shift

**Date**: 2025-08-09

This document marks the starting point for a significant architectural improvement to the `bchat` system.

The current file-monitoring approach is considered fragile and a potential point of failure. A new proposal has been created to address this by shifting to a more robust direct chat export mechanism.

This new proposal is the primary focus of the current development stage. All other development activities should be secondary to the implementation and validation of this architectural shift.

**Please review the full proposal here:**
