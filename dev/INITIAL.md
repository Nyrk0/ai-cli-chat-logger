## Current Focus

The project is now following a structured, stage-based development approach with:
- Gate-controlled progression through defined stages
- Comprehensive status tracking and coordination
- Multi-AI collaboration framework development
- Iterative implementation with explicit approval gates

**Next Action**: Define ST_00 MVP requirements and begin foundation development.

## Development Protocol

All development activities should:
1. Reference the [Stages Workflow](dev_stages/stages_workflow.md) for current status

3. Follow the gate-controlled progression protocol
4. Maintain continuous documentation and status updates
