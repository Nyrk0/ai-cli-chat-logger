# bchat Implementation Safety Directives

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-08  
**Status**: MANDATORY - MUST BE FOLLOWED  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **CORE SAFETY PRINCIPLES**

### **RULE #1: NEVER BREAK WORKING COMPONENTS**
- If a feature works, it must continue working after changes
- Test existing functionality before and after every change
- Any breaking change requires immediate rollback
- Document all changes to working functionality

### **RULE #2: CHECKPOINT BEFORE CHANGES**
- Create system backup before starting any stage
- Test rollback procedure before making changes
- Use git branches for experimental changes
- Maintain known-good state at all times

### **RULE #3: VALIDATE CONTINUOUSLY**
- Run validation suite after every change
- Test functionality manually when automated tests pass
- Check logs for new errors after changes
- Verify configuration integrity after modifications

### **RULE #4: INCREMENTAL CHANGES ONLY**
- Make smallest possible changes
- One issue per commit/change
- Test immediately after each change
- Stop and rollback if anything breaks

## üîÑ **MANDATORY PROCEDURES**

### **Before Starting Any Stage:**
1. ‚úÖ Run complete validation suite
2. ‚úÖ Create system backup
3. ‚úÖ Test rollback procedure  
4. ‚úÖ Document current working state
5. ‚úÖ Create git branch for stage work

### **During Stage Development:**
1. ‚úÖ Make incremental changes only
2. ‚úÖ Test after each change
3. ‚úÖ Document what changed and why
4. ‚úÖ Check for regressions in existing functionality
5. ‚úÖ Update validation tests if needed

### **Before Completing Any Stage:**
1. ‚úÖ Run full validation suite
2. ‚úÖ Test all previously working functionality
3. ‚úÖ Verify all stage exit criteria met
4. ‚úÖ Update documentation
5. ‚úÖ Merge to main branch only when validated

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ROLLBACK TRIGGERS**

**Immediate rollback required if:**
- Any previously working command stops working
- Validation suite fails
- System becomes unstable
- New errors appear in logs
- Configuration becomes invalid
- Dependencies break

**Rollback Procedure:**
1. Stop all development work immediately
2. Execute stage rollback script
3. Verify system returns to previous working state
4. Run validation suite to confirm restoration
5. Analyze what went wrong before proceeding

---

## üß™ **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

### **Validation Test Categories:**
1. **Command Functionality**: All user-facing commands work
2. **Configuration Integrity**: Config files valid and loadable
3. **Dependency Resolution**: All imports and modules accessible
4. **File Structure**: Required directories and files present
5. **Process Management**: Processes start/stop correctly
6. **API Integration**: API calls succeed (where configured)
7. **Data Persistence**: JSON files created and readable

### **Testing Frequency:**
- **After every change**: Quick smoke test
- **End of each work session**: Full validation suite
- **Before stage completion**: Comprehensive manual testing
- **Before merging**: Complete end-to-end testing

---

## üìä **QUALITY GATES**

### **Stage Gate Requirements:**
Each stage must meet ALL criteria before proceeding:

1. **‚úÖ Functionality Gate**: All previous functionality working
2. **‚úÖ Stability Gate**: No new errors or instability
3. **‚úÖ Integration Gate**: New features integrate cleanly
4. **‚úÖ Documentation Gate**: Changes documented completely
5. **‚úÖ Testing Gate**: All tests pass, manual testing complete

### **Stage Exit Validation:**
```bash
# Must all pass before proceeding to next stage
./dev_stages/ST_XX/validation.sh
./bchat --status  # Must show healthy status
./bchat           # Must complete successfully
git status        # Must be clean
```

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If System Becomes Unusable:**
1. **STOP** all development work
2. Execute emergency rollback: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
3. Restore from backup if needed
4. Run validation suite to confirm recovery
5. Document what caused the issue
6. Plan safer approach before continuing

### **If Dependencies Break:**
1. Check virtual environment integrity
2. Restore requirements.txt if needed
3. Reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Test in clean environment
5. Document dependency conflicts

### **If Configuration Corrupts:**
1. Restore config files from backup
2. Validate JSON syntax
3. Test configuration loading
4. Check for syntax errors
5. Verify API keys still valid

---

## üìù **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Required Documentation for Each Stage:**
1. **Change Log**: What changed, why, and how
2. **Test Results**: Validation suite results
3. **Issues Encountered**: Problems and solutions
4. **Rollback Log**: Any rollbacks performed
5. **Stage Summary**: Key achievements and lessons learned

### **File Updates Required:**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for significant changes
- Update `README.md` if user-facing changes
- Update configuration documentation if config changes
- Update validation tests if functionality changes

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Each Stage Must Achieve:**
- All previous functionality preserved
- New functionality working correctly
- No new errors in logs
- Validation suite passes 100%
- Documentation complete and current
- System stable and reliable

### **Final System Must Achieve:**
- Zero manual intervention required
- All features working reliably
- Graceful error handling
- Production-ready stability
- Complete user documentation
