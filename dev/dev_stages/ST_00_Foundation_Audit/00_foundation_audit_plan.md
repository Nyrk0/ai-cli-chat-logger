# ST_00: Foundation Audit and Baseline

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Estimated Duration**: 1 session  

## 🎯 **Objective**
Establish working baseline and validation framework to ensure no functionality is lost during subsequent development stages.

## 📋 **Tasks Checklist**

- [ ] **Complete System Audit**
  - [ ] Test all currently working commands
  - [ ] Document exact working state
  - [ ] Identify all broken/partial functionality
  - [ ] Create functionality matrix

- [ ] **Create Validation Test Suite**
  - [ ] Basic command functionality tests
  - [ ] Configuration validation tests  
  - [ ] File structure validation tests
  - [ ] API integration tests (current state)

- [ ] **Establish Rollback System**
  - [ ] Create full system backup
  - [ ] Test git rollback procedures
  - [ ] Document restoration process
  - [ ] Verify backup integrity

- [ ] **Create Development Directives**
  - [ ] Define mandatory validation procedures
  - [ ] Establish change control process
  - [ ] Create testing requirements
  - [ ] Document rollback triggers

## ✅ **Entry Criteria**
- Current system state as-is (no prerequisites)
- Git repository in known state
- Basic system functionality partially working

## 🎯 **Exit Criteria**
- [ ] ✅ All currently working features documented and tested
- [ ] ✅ Baseline validation suite passes 100%  
- [ ] ✅ Rollback procedure tested and verified
- [ ] ✅ Development directives established
- [ ] ✅ System state backup created and verified

## 🔧 **Validation Commands**
```bash
# Basic functionality validation
./bchat --status
./bchat
source dev/venv/bin/activate && python3 core/src/auto_detect.py
ls -la config/config.json data/chats/ data/logs/

# Test suite execution
./dev_stages/ST_00/validation.sh
```

## 📊 **Expected Outcomes**
1. **Functionality Matrix**: Complete list of what works vs. what doesn't
2. **Validation Suite**: Automated tests for current functionality
3. **Baseline Backup**: Recoverable system state
4. **Development Framework**: Safe development procedures

## ⚠️ **Risk Mitigation**
- **Low Risk Stage**: Only auditing and testing, no code changes
- **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved as-is
- **Reversible Actions**: Only creating new files, no modifications

## 📁 **Deliverables**
- `audit_report.md` - Complete system functionality audit
- `validation.sh` - Automated validation test suite  
- `backup/` - System state backup
- `rollback.sh` - Tested rollback procedure
- `dev_directives.md` - Development control procedures
