# bchat Foundational Goals and User Cases

**Purpose**: Define core and extended functions to guide implementation priorities
**Created**: 2025-08-08
**Status**: Draft for semantic analysis

---

## üéØ **CORE FUNCTIONS** (Must Have - Essential)

### **CF-01: AI Conversation Capture**
**What**: Automatically capture and log AI chat conversations from CLI tools
**User Case**: 
- Developer using Claude Code wants to keep a record of their coding sessions
- User wants to review what they discussed with AI assistants yesterday
**Success Criteria**: Raw conversation logs are captured without user intervention

### **CF-02: Intelligent Processing & Structuring** 
**What**: Convert raw chat logs into structured, searchable JSON data
**User Case**:
- Developer wants to search through months of AI conversations for specific solutions
- User needs to find "that conversation where we fixed the database issue"
**Success Criteria**: JSON files created with keywords, summaries, and metadata

### **CF-03: Universal Access**
**What**: `bchat` command works from anywhere in workspace, any time
**User Case**:
- User is deep in project subdirectory, types `bchat` and it just works
- User wants to backup current conversation without navigating to bchat folder
**Success Criteria**: Command works from any directory in workspace

### **CF-04: Zero-Friction Backup**
**What**: Simple `bchat` command triggers immediate backup/consolidation
**User Case**:
- User finishes important AI conversation, types `bchat` to save it
- User wants peace of mind that their AI interactions are preserved
**Success Criteria**: One command saves and processes current conversation

## üåü **EXTENDED FUNCTIONS** (Nice to Have - Value Add)

### **EF-01: Real-time Monitoring**
**What**: Automatically process conversations as they happen (background service)
**User Case**:
- Power user wants automatic processing without remembering to run `bchat`
- User wants immediate JSON generation when they use trigger words
**Success Criteria**: Background service processes conversations automatically

### **EF-02: Multi-Provider Intelligence**
**What**: Support both Claude and Gemini APIs for processing with auto-detection
**User Case**:
- User has access to multiple AI providers, wants to use the best available
- User's API quota runs out on one provider, wants automatic fallback
**Success Criteria**: System detects and uses available API automatically

### **EF-03: Cross-Session Context**
**What**: Maintain context and relationship between conversation sessions
**User Case**:
- User working on multi-day project, wants AI to understand context from previous days
- User wants to see conversation patterns and development progression over time
**Success Criteria**: Context summary tracks related conversations across sessions

### **EF-04: Advanced Search & Analytics**
**What**: Rich search through conversation history with smart filtering
**User Case**:
- User wants to find all conversations about "React hooks" from last month
- Developer wants to analyze their AI interaction patterns and productivity
**Success Criteria**: Complex queries return relevant conversations with ranking

### **EF-05: Integration Ecosystem**
**What**: VSCode integration, status monitoring, development workflow integration
**User Case**:
- Developer wants bchat status in VSCode status bar
- User wants to see AI conversation metrics in their development dashboard
**Success Criteria**: Seamless integration with existing development tools

2. AI conversations automatically processed and structured
3. Uses context from previous sessions to inform new conversations
4. Switches between AI providers seamlessly

### **Persona 3: The Enterprise Developer**
**Profile**: Professional developer, needs reliability and integration
**Primary Use Cases**: All CF + EF-01, EF-04, EF-05
**User Journey**:
1. bchat integrated into development workflow
2. Automatic capture of all AI interactions
3. Advanced search for knowledge management
4. Metrics and analytics for team productivity

## ü§î **QUESTIONS FOR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS**

**For Gemini to analyze and refine:**

1. **Function Priority**: Are these the right core vs. extended functions? What's missing?
2. **User Cases**: Do these user scenarios reflect real-world usage patterns?
3. **Success Criteria**: Are the success metrics measurable and achievable?
4. **MVP Scope**: Is the MVP scope appropriate for initial release?
5. **User Journey**: Are the user journeys realistic and valuable?
6. **Gap Analysis**: What functionality gaps exist between current state and goals?
7. **Implementation Complexity**: Which functions are most complex to implement reliably?
8. **User Value Ranking**: Which functions provide the highest user value vs. implementation cost?

## üìä **CURRENT STATE vs. GOALS ANALYSIS**

### **What We Have Now**:
- ‚úÖ Basic conversation capture (CF-01) - Partially working
- ‚úÖ JSON processing (CF-02) - Working but has API errors
- ‚ùå Universal access (CF-03) - Broken (requires manual venv activation)  
- ‚úÖ Manual backup (CF-04) - Working
- ‚ùå Real-time monitoring (EF-01) - Broken (daemon doesn't persist)
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider support (EF-02) - Working with auto-detection
- ‚úÖ Basic cross-session context (EF-03) - Working
- ‚ùå Advanced search (EF-04) - Not implemented
- ‚ùå Integration ecosystem (EF-05) - Not implemented

### **Priority Implementation Order**:
1. **Fix CF-03** (Universal Access) - Critical for user experience
2. **Fix EF-01** (Real-time Monitoring) - Core value proposition  
3. **Fix CF-02** (API Processing) - Reliability essential
4. **Enhance EF-02** (Multi-provider) - Already mostly working
5. **Develop EF-04** (Search) - Future version
6. **Develop EF-05** (Integration) - Future version
