User: I'm trying to write a python script to list all the files in a directory. Can you help me with that?

Gemini: Of course. You can use the `os` module in Python. Here is a simple script:

```python
import os

directory = '.' # current directory

for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    print(filename)
```

User: Thanks! How can I make it recursive to also list files in subdirectories?

Gemini: You can use `os.walk()` for that. It's very powerful. Here is how you would do it:

```python
import os

directory = '.' # current directory

for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(directory):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirpath, filename))
```
This will print the full path to each file in the directory and all its subdirectories.

User: Perfect. This is exactly what I needed.
