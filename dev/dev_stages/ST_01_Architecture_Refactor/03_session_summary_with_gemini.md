# Session Summary: The Great Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Stage**: ST_01 (Architecture Refactor)
**Author**: Gemini Assistant

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the intensive development session that led to a major architectural refactoring of the `bchat` project, the fixing of numerous critical bugs, and the establishment of a new, ambitious vision for the project's future.

## 2. Initial State and Analysis

The session began with an analysis of the existing `bchat` project. The initial architecture was a daemon-based, real-time file monitoring system that was found to be complex and fragile. The core goal of the project, "Technical Context Preservation", was not being fully realized.

## 3. The Architectural Shift

A key insight from the user led to a major strategic shift. Instead of passively monitoring log files, `bchat` would be re-architected to be an on-demand processor that reads chat history directly from the AI CLIs' local storage directories. This new architecture was deemed to be more robust, simpler, and more efficient.

## 4. The Bug Hunt

The process of implementing and testing the new architecture revealed several underlying bugs in the original codebase:

*   **API Key Detection Failure**: The installer was not correctly detecting the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
*   **"Command Not Found" Error**: The installer was not correctly making the `bchat` command available system-wide.
*   **Pathing and Wrapper Script Errors**: The `bchat` command and its wrappers had several bugs that caused them to fail when run.

All of these bugs were successfully identified and fixed.

## 5. The New Vision: The Deep Context Engine

The session culminated in a new, ambitious vision for `bchat` as a true "Context-Aware Prompting Engine". This new vision was broken down into a three-phase development roadmap:

*   **Phase 1: Basic Context Engine (MVP)**: The successful implementation of a working MVP that can answer contextual questions based on the `bchat` logs.
*   **Phase 2: Advanced Context**: The integration of richer context from the AI CLIs' internal files (e.g., `~/.claude/shell-snapshots`).
*   **Phase 3: Ultimate Vision**: The creation of a true multi-AI collaboration hub.

## 6. Current Status

As of the end of this session, the following has been achieved:

*   The project has been successfully refactored to the new, on-demand architecture.
*   All identified bugs have been fixed.
*   Phase 1 of the new vision, the Basic Context Engine MVP, has been fully implemented and tested successfully.

The project is now stable and ready to begin Phase 2.
