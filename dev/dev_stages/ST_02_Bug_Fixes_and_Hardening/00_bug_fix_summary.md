# Bug Fix Summary

This document summarizes the key bugs that were identified and fixed during the initial refactoring of the `bchat` project.

## 1. API Key Detection Failure

*   **Symptom**: The `install.sh` script and the `bchat-status` command were not correctly detecting the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
*   **Root Cause**: The `core/src/auto_detect.py` script was not loading the `.env` file before checking for the environment variables.
*   **Fix**: Modified `auto_detect.py` to load the `.env` file, ensuring that all API keys are correctly detected.

## 2. "Command Not Found" Error

*   **Symptom**: The `bchat` command was not available system-wide after running `install.sh`.
*   **Root Cause**: The `install.sh` script was missing a step to create a symbolic link to the `bchat` executable in a directory in the user's `PATH`.
*   **Fix**: Added a `create_symlink` function to `install.sh` that creates a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin`, making the command universally accessible.

## 3. Script Path Resolution Error

*   **Symptom**: The `bchat` command failed with a "No such file or directory" error when trying to find its wrapper scripts.
*   **Root Cause**: The script was using a simple path resolution method that did not work correctly when the script was run as a symbolic link from a different location.
*   **Fix**: Implemented a more robust path resolution mechanism in the `bchat` script that correctly handles symbolic links.

## 4. Command Stall / Hang

*   **Symptom**: The `bchat <prompt>` command would hang indefinitely.
*   **Root Cause**: The `gemini_wrapper.sh` script was designed only for interactive sessions and was not correctly handling non-interactive commands with arguments.
*   **Fix**: Modified the wrapper script to detect whether it is being run in interactive or non-interactive mode and to handle each case appropriately.
