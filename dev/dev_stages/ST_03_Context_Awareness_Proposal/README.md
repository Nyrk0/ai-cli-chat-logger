# ST_03: Context Awareness Proposal

This stage is dedicated to the design and proposal of the new "Context-Aware Prompting" feature.

This feature will allow `bchat` to understand contextual prompts (e.g., "remember our function from last week") by searching its indexed history and injecting the relevant context into the prompt before sending it to the AI.

The documents in this stage will outline the vision, technical architecture, and implementation plan for this new feature.
