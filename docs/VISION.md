# bchat: The Long-Term Vision

This document captures the long-term, state-of-the-art goals for the `bchat` project. These are the ambitious ideas that we are building towards.

## 1. The Deep Context Engine (Phases 1-3)

The immediate vision is to create a powerful "Deep Context Engine" that can understand and leverage the full context of a project, including not just chat logs, but also the AI's own internal working files (`shell-snapshots`, `todos`, etc.). This will enable `bchat` to provide highly intelligent, context-aware responses.

## 2. The Meta-Methodology Engine (Phase 4/5)

The next major vision is to evolve `bchat` into a "Meta-Methodology Engine". This will involve:

*   **Analyzing** the development process of a completed project.
*   **Synthesizing** a reusable, AI-powered development methodology from that analysis.
*   **Guiding** new projects to follow this proven methodology.

## 3. The AI Task Delegation Hub (Phase 6)

The ultimate vision is for `bchat` to become an intelligent "AI Task Delegation Hub". This would involve:

*   **AI Self-Awareness**: An AI assistant (like Gemini) would be able to recognize when it is struggling with a particular task (e.g., repeated failures of a tool).
*   **Task Handoff**: The struggling AI would be able to package up the current task (the goal, the context, the failed attempts) and hand it off to `bchat`.
*   **Intelligent Routing**: `bchat` would then be able to route the task to another AI assistant (like Claude) that might have different strengths, enabling a seamless, multi-AI collaborative workflow.
