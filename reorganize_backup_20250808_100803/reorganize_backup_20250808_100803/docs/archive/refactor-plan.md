# bchat Refactoring Plan

### Audit and Refactoring Plan

The current file structure has bchat's components scattered across several directories (`stages/`, `utils/`, root). The `stages/` directory, in particular, appears to be a temporary development area and is not suitable for permanent application code.

To create a robust and maintainable structure, I propose consolidating all related files into a single, self-contained top-level directory called `bchat/`.

### Proposed Permanent File Structure

```
/Users/admin/Documents/Developer/meli/
├── bchat/
│   ├── install.sh
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── config.template.json
│   ├── bchat
│   ├── gemini_wrapper.sh
│   ├── docs/
│   │   ├── chat_bkup_as_llm_plan.md
│   │   ├── chat_monitor_standalone_plan.md
│   │   ├── IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
│   │   └── ... (all other documentation)
│   └── src/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── main.py
│       └── utils/
│           ├── __init__.py
│           └── path_manager.py
│
├── apps/
├── bodega/
├── chats/
├── logs/
└── ... (rest of the project structure)
```

### Benefits of This Structure

*   **Self-Contained:** All the application's code, scripts, and documentation are in one place, making it easy to manage, version, and install.
*   **Standardization:** This structure follows common practices for including a standalone tool within a larger monorepo.
*   **Decoupling:** It cleanly separates the monitor from the rest of the project's code, preventing conflicts and improving clarity.
*   **Permanence:** It moves the application out of the temporary `stages/` directory into a permanent, top-level home.

### Action Plan to Achieve the New Structure

1.  **Create the Main Directory:**
    *   Create the new top-level directory: `chat_monitor/`

2.  **Restructure the Application Code:**
    *   Create the new source directory: `chat_monitor/src/` and `chat_monitor/src/utils/`.
    *   Move the main script from `stages/stage_00_refactor/chat_monitor_py_proyect/chat_monitor.py` to `chat_monitor/src/main.py`.
    *   Move the path manager from `utils/path_manager.py` to `chat_monitor/src/utils/path_manager.py`.
    *   Create `__init__.py` files in `chat_monitor/src/` and `chat_monitor/src/utils/` to make them Python packages.

3.  **Consolidate Scripts and Configuration:**
    *   Move the `bchat` and `gemini_wrapper.sh` scripts from the project root into `chat_monitor/`.
    *   Create `chat_monitor/requirements.txt` with the necessary Python dependencies (`watchdog`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`).
    *   Create `chat_monitor/config.template.json` based on the root `config.json`.

4.  **Organize Documentation:**
    *   Create a new `chat_monitor/docs/` directory.
    *   Move all documentation files from `stages/stage_00_refactor/chat_monitor_py_proyect/` into `chat_monitor/docs/`.

5.  **Create the Installer:**
    *   Create the `chat_monitor/install.sh` script. This script will handle creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and copying the configuration, as detailed in the standalone application plan.

6.  **Cleanup (Trash Old Folders):**
    *   After all files have been moved, the entire `stages/stage_00_refactor/chat_monitor_py_proyect/` directory can be safely deleted.
    *   The root `utils/` directory can also be deleted if `path_manager.py` was its only content.
