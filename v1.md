# Before bchat: Context Query Test

**Question Asked**: "What did we work on regarding Claude collaboration in this project?"

**Claude's Response (without context-aware bchat)**:
I don't have access to previous conversations or project history. I can help you work on Claude collaboration topics if you provide me with specific information about what you're trying to achieve or what aspects of Claude collaboration you're working on.

Some areas where Claude collaboration is typically relevant:
- API integration and authentication
- Prompt engineering and context management
- Multi-AI workflows and task handoffs
- Code review and collaborative development
- Documentation and knowledge management

Could you share more details about your specific collaboration needs with Claude?
